# frontend-base-template
This template is for you if you want a quick start to your frontend related projects! It converts and compresses your scss files into css files and compresses your js files and creates a min.js file. In this way, after making the necessary imports, your files created under the dist folder become "ready for deployment" directly. Besides; You can build structures dynamically using ready variables such as color, typography, font sizes, responsive mixin's, spacing.
